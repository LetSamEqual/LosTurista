    "blogPostBodyCopy": ["‘Hi Sam, we hear you are going travelling overseas. What an amazing time you will have, places to see and people to meet. We wish you a happy, safe and wonderful adventure. Cheers’ - Janelle and Lex", "‘Enjoy the adventures brother. I’ll follow your tales. See you in Melbourne town in a few months.’ - Liam", "‘Safe travels mah boy!!’ - The Big Pink", "‘Get some pretty photos <3’ - JJ Boo", "‘Bon voyage. S xo’ - Dad and Sally", "[Far too long to quote and far too touching to share] - Sam #2", "‘Safe travels my darling! Love you to the moon and back’ - Mum", "### Chapter 1: Breaking news!", "Warning! Deranged man at large. Last seen hurtling towards the international airport without regard for law, traffic lights or common sense.", "Witnesses on the scene describe a man with crazed hair and wide eyes, looking everywhere but the road in front of him. They say this man repeatedly failed to indicate, except once, the wrong way and likely by accident, when he stuck an arm and half his body out the window to shake a tattered copy of The Motorcycle Diaries at a driver recklessly obeying the speed limit near him. The man’s place in the book was reportedly being kept by a crumpled ticket to the former socialist country of Chile. The Uber driver, at that point cowering in the passenger seat next to the deranged man, is now in hospital recovering from the shock.", "While details are still emerging, this paper has uncovered the following facts: renowned champagne communist and man of infamously unrestrained id, Sam Henderson, recently escaped gainful employment to pursue his dream of being a ‘full-time layabout’.", "Friends and family say they regret ignoring the early warning signs that have now manifested in his total psychotic break. At the time they believed it was only a prolonged but certainly temporary bout of Marxism brought on by years of abusing radical theory. When contacted, his mother had this to say:", "‘Look it was of course concerning to find a copy of Das Kapital under his bed in high school, but at the time I told myself that a lot of kids his age were experimenting with recreational philosophies. I mean god, I went to the Chicago School of Fine Arts — I spent six months calling all my friends ‘comrade’, so this didn’t seem that different.", "‘But since then he’s apparently been getting into the harder stuff like Fischer and Zizek, and well … that’s when I really started to worry. Political philosophies are a lot stronger these days given what they’re synthesising it with. But still, I never thought … I’m sorry, let’s end it there.’", "When interviewed later, the Uber driver, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, says he only remembers fragments of the ordeal and that honestly he wishes he could remember less. However, with assistance from the hospital psychologist and a priest, this paper learnt that the driver had been parked on the side of the road, enjoying ‘a perfectly decent oat latte’, when his door was suddenly yanked open by a crazed man, who threw a large backpack at the driver and yelled ‘move over you bastard, I’m driving’.", "Later, as they hit the highway, the deranged man began interrogating the then ex-driver for opinions on his beard. ‘He just kept asking if I thought he looked more Guevara or Castro-esque. Over and over. Eventually I said Guevara, which I think was the right answer because he stopped asking and began humming the Cuban national anthem, but really it looked more homeless than anything else.’", "Afterwards, when the driver began to pray, the man yelled that there was no need to panic because soon he’d be ‘lifting the boot of capitalism off the necks of the working class so they can finally breathe the fresh air of liberty’. The driver, at that point hysterical, tried to explain that he’s a full-time graphic designer, that this was just a side hustle he does for art supply money, and that his neck feels perfectly untrodden upon but thank you for asking. The deranged man appeared not be listening however, and instead began to nod insanely while whispering ‘I am the child of the revolution’. At that point the former driver decided the best course of action was to remain silent.", "According to police reports, the hijacked KIA Allantro was next seen screeching into the international drop-off zone in a shower of neck pillows and 100mL containers ejected from the luggage of leaping pedestrians. Security camera footage show the deranged man parking the car first halfway up the curb, and then after a few minutes of struggle, the rest of the way up, leaving the traffic officer baffled at where to even start. At this point the deranged man took both of the shivering Uber driver’s hands in his own, promised that he would remember his service when ‘they begin constructing the guillotines’ and then stiffed him on the tip.", "The last thing the driver remembers seeing before passing out was a skinny man with a large backpack hurtling red-roped bollards, headed towards security, armed with an unnatural certainty that everything was going to turn out just fine."],
