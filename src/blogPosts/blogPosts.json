Cheers’ - Janelle and Lex", "‘Enjoy the adventures brother. I’ll follow your tales.

Deranged man at large. Last seen hurtling towards the international airport without regard for law, traffic lights or common sense.", "Witnesses on the scene describe a man with crazed hair and wide eyes, looking everywhere but the road in front of him. They say this man repeatedly failed to indicate, except once, the wrong way and likely by accident, when he stuck an arm and half his body out the window to shake a tattered copy of The Motorcycle Diaries at a driver recklessly obeying the speed limit near him. The man’s place in the book was reportedly being kept by a crumpled ticket to the former socialist country of Chile. The Uber driver, at that point cowering in the passenger seat next to the deranged man, is now in hospital recovering from the shock.", "While details are still emerging, this paper has uncovered the following facts: renowned champagne communist and man of infamously unrestrained id, Sam Henderson, recently escaped gainful employment to pursue his dream of being a ‘full-time layabout’.", "Friends and family say they regret ignoring the early warning signs that have now manifested in his total psychotic break. At the time they believed it was only a prolonged but certainly temporary bout of Marxism brought on by years of abusing radical theory. When contacted, his mother had this to say:", "‘Look it was of course concerning to find a copy of Das Kapital under his bed in high school, but at the time I told myself that a lot of kids his age were experimenting with recreational philosophies. I mean god, I went to the Chicago School of Fine Arts — I spent six months calling all my friends ‘comrade’, so this didn’t seem that different.", "‘But since then he’s apparently been getting into the harder stuff like Fischer and Zizek, and well … that’s when I really started to worry. Political philosophies are a lot stronger these days given what they’re synthesising it with. But still, I never thought … I’m sorry, let’s end it there.’", "When interviewed later, the Uber driver, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, says he only remembers fragments of the ordeal and that honestly he wishes he could remember less. However, with assistance from the hospital psychologist and a priest, this paper learnt that the driver had been parked on the side of the road, enjoying ‘a perfectly decent oat latte’, when his door was suddenly yanked open by a crazed man, who threw a large backpack at the driver and yelled ‘move over you bastard, I’m driving’.", "Later, as they hit the highway, the deranged man began interrogating the then ex-driver for opinions on his beard. ‘He just kept asking if I thought he looked more Guevara or Castro-esque. Over and over. Eventually I said Guevara, which I think was the right answer because he stopped asking and began humming the Cuban national anthem, but really it looked more homeless than anything else.’", "Afterwards, when the driver began to pray, the man yelled that there was no need to panic because soon he’d be ‘lifting the boot of capitalism off the necks of the working class so they can finally breathe the fresh air of liberty’. The driver, at that point hysterical, tried to explain that he’s a full-time graphic designer, that this was just a side hustle he does for art supply money, and that his neck feels perfectly untrodden upon but thank you for asking. The deranged man appeared not be listening however, and instead began to nod insanely while whispering ‘I am the child of the revolution’. At that point the former driver decided the best course of action was to remain silent.", "According to police reports, the hijacked KIA Allantro was next seen screeching into the international drop-off zone in a shower of neck pillows and 100mL containers ejected from the luggage of leaping pedestrians. Security camera footage show the deranged man parking the car first halfway up the curb, and then after a few minutes of struggle, the rest of the way up, leaving the traffic officer baffled at where to even start. At this point the deranged man took both of the shivering Uber driver’s hands in his own, promised that he would remember his service when ‘they begin constructing the guillotines’ and then stiffed him on the tip.", "The last thing the driver remembers seeing before passing out was a skinny man with a large backpack hurtling red-roped bollards, headed towards security, armed with an unnatural certainty that everything was going to turn out just fine."],

I’ve spent the last 13 hours in a high-speed middle finger to God, travelling at 1,000km/h halfway around the curve of the Earth just to make sure he gets a good look at it.", "Now, as punishment, he’s landed us in the most soulless and psychopathic viper’s nest to ever infest this good, green Earth: American border control.", "It’s the bag full of explosives that I’m worried about.", "A carry-on filled to capacity with Klein, Chomsky, Fischer, Mao’s Little Red Book, The Open Veins of Latin America. The most depraved and twisted minds of recent history splattered in ink and serif across hundreds of pages. All of it intended to blow a hole wide open in the swaying monolith of late-stage capitalism. A Jenga tower built to mind-bending heights with material pulled from its own foundations, now leaning precariously, waiting for someone to pull that last block. Or … for someone to tip the table.", "Don’t worry America, help is on its way. I just need to get this literary C4 past the bastards in uniform.", "The agent directly ahead of me is sitting within some kind of Perspex cube, the bottom half of his body out of sight, or potentially removed, neutered to ensure commitment to duty, honour and American spirit.", "It is a common belief that fascism is a masculine ideology, and so requires the necessary equipment to perform it correctly. But this is not true. What a dictator wants more than anything is an army of sexless clones, unburdened by choice or needs. Certainly not men contaminated with all their instincts and urges. If anything, fascism is ace. A million short, back and sides–sporting Ken dolls, all smooth below the eyebrows. And while I don’t think America has got there yet, it surely is a matter of time.", "I’m wondering whether they’d just take the balls or keep it easy and remove anything that dangles when I realise I’m up next.", "Will they see the socialist in my eyes, I wonder, or just assume it? Will the flight attendants discover what’s been blocking the plane’s toilets for the second half of the ride? A mound of scraggly, slogan-filled beard hair, shaved in anticipation of this exact moment. Will they call up ahead to tell them that there’s a baby-faced revolutionary attempting to mix in with the regular, freedom-loving passengers?", "‘Attention all officers and would-be vigilantes, we have a commie on the loose, some ex-bearded freak of politics, possibly holding a carry-on bloated with anti-American propaganda, clearly intending to sow dissent among the poor and feeble-minded. We advise to shoot on sight. I repeat, shoot on sight.’", "I lean over the counter when I arrive and see that the man does appear to have a lower body, which is a relief, though his expression is that of a creature with nothing left to its name besides the privilege of being the country’s first line of defence, so my relief is in no way total.", "As we go through the usual process of name, passport, ESTA, address while in America, rising moon sign and Hogwarts house, we come to the question of next destinations, and as suspected, the process stops.", "My trip to South America is immediately noted as suspicious. I can see the words ‘Guatemala, Venezuela, Chile, Cuba’ beginning to circle his head like some hideous bats. The recent history of government-backed coups fresh in the Latin American mind and wholly forgotten by US citizens besides an unconscious distrust of the continent as a whole. He squints at me.", "‘Why are you going to South America?’", "‘Just a holiday.’", "‘Just a holiday?’", "‘Just a holiday.’", "‘Right. And what do you plan to do on this holiday?’", "I don’t know. What do regular, freedom loving, capitalist-supporting, wholly unsuspicious people do on any holiday? Is the word ‘holiday’ not all-encompassing? Is there any other way to holiday, and is one of them wrong? He’s staring. I’ve got to answer.", "‘Well to ensure that America’s interests remain protected of course. Operation Mongoose 2.0. Continue the US-backed psyops in the land of fruit and sugar sir.’", "‘What?’", "‘Backpacking.’", "‘Backpacking?’", "‘Yes sir.’", "‘I see … ’", "He looks down at the bag next to me.", "‘What’s in that?’", "‘Twelve dozen rounds of ammunition, a quart of vodka and a map of high-density areas.’", "He nods, somewhat soothed by the fact that I intend to assimilate. But still, his expression is sinister. The mood twisted. It’s too little too late and his hand is already on the big red button clearly attached to a silent alarm. I’ve prepared for this scenario however, and I have an ace up my sleeve.", "I clear my throat to get his attention, then I point a finger directly at my face. The message is clear. I’m a white English-speaker. There’s nothing he can do. His hands are tied. He sighs and moves his hands away from the button, his shoulders slumped. There will be no commendation for his service today.", "He stamps my passport, registers my fingerprints, takes a photo and performs a perfunctory cavity search before waving me on.", "Of course I was never worried. My quick wit and Invisalign smile has gotten me through rougher patches than whatever can be concocted by some castrated weirdo trapped in a box.", "I stride through to baggage collection, a free man. Around me, hoards of grim-faced tourists squinting and leaning and bobbing in hope that the particular black, wheeled luggage coming around the bend is their black, wheeled luggage. But it isn’t, and it won’t be, because it’s already lost. It was thrown out before the plane took off to save them the trouble of having to lose it later.", "It’s a known fact that somewhere out there on the Pacific is a floating island of black, wheeled luggage – baking in the sun, covered in barnacles, bouncing off breaching whales and melting icebergs, following some great gyre to the promised land that all lost things eventually wash up. It’s a miracle of nature, one that my particular bag unfortunately will not be a part of as I have stuffed my life and my profane material into one carry-on sized bag that has not and will not leave my side for the rest of this trip.", "I stride past these leaning, bobbing suckers scratching their heads about where their luggage has gone.", "I am the enlightened traveler. King of vagabonds and vagrants. A human RV with a full tank and an open highway ahead of me, aimed at a place beyond borders or order, no tether to the spiritual highs I can and will achieve.", "‘Sir, can we have a quick word with you?’", "Shit.", "### Some history about LA, as told by an Uber driver on the way to my cousin’s house", "It’s a little known fact that entropy was discovered through a careful examination of LA traffic.", "The conditions move further towards chaos the closer we get to the city. And yet somehow there is a rhythm to it. A communal understanding. Each spot on the highway is yours for the taking, you just have to be brave enough to take it. This is communicated in every honk, every middle finger, every scream out of the driver’s window. This is language of the road, and it is beautiful.", "‘Man I get flipped off twice a day in this city. At least twice a day. It’s just part of living in LA.’ The Uber driver screams. All the windows are open, letting in the smog so we can achieve that woozy kind of high that makes a long drive feel like teleportation.", "‘Well let’s try to get it done now,’ I say. ‘Save you from having to worry about it for the rest of the day.’", "‘Good point,’ he says and then merges suddenly across three lanes to another lane moving slightly faster. A loud honk. One down.", "‘Some of them have full-time jobs man,’ he says, back on the tents we’ve been discussing, each containing some of LA’s 70,000 homeless. Everywhere we go they seem to outnumber the buildings.", "‘It’s crazy. Even in the slums you’re paying at least $2,500 a month for a one bedroom. $2,500 and you’re still gonna get robbed in your own home. Say you’re a security guard getting paid $3,000 a month, you’re still living in a tent. It’s capitalism man. People are buying houses just to make money, and if you don’t have any then you don’t get a house. Simple as that.’", "Familiar story. But it’s nice to know it’s not just us. I will learn later that what we call negative gearing is called the appreciation tax.", "We make a sharp turn on to an exit from about two lanes away and for a moment the direction of our car becomes perpendicular to the flow of the traffic. The honks are starting to become soothing.", "‘I don’t know about you, but sometimes you have to wonder if Covid was a scam.’ My eyebrows shoot into orbit. I mean of course, but still, it’s bold. I remind myself to add him to my mailing list.", "‘Maybe I’m crazy man. I don’t know. I went along with it fine for a while. But now … now things are worse man, but only for some people.’", "The roads are starting to narrow, the size of the housing shrinking from apartments to homes, all painted white.", "‘It just seems like …  I don’t know. It’s bad. It’s bad everywhere man.’", "We’re turning on to my cousin’s street. There’s been maybe five seconds of silence, which for this ride is an eternity. Eventually he turns to me and says, ‘but hey, at least the weather is nice here.’", "I nod and look at the window. It’s true. It’s a beautiful day.", "By coincidence my cousin is standing outside with the whole family: husband, child, the family dog. It’s a entirely warming scene. There is no irony or cynicism. Her husband, Andrew, is American by birth and endlessly positive. My cousin, Stephi, passes her baby Leo to Andrew and hugs me.", "I have a shower and pass out for three hours. I wake up confused, shaky, entirely unsure where I am and how I got there. I wander around the house trying to sort it all out. I walk into rooms just to forget why I’m there. I open the fridge, then close it, then open it again. There’s artisanal sour dough in the freezer. It’s delicious.", "By the time I make it outside it’s midday. The sky is a deep blue and cloudless. There are palm trees lining the street, and all the lawns are a stunning green.", "### A day at the beach", "Above me, people are screaming and the sound is dropping towards me at a tremendous rate. When I look up to find the source of the noise, someone shoves me from behind, nearly knocking me to the ground. I spin around and punch a mother in the face, but she barely registers the blow. She had of course woken up that morning knowing she was going to be taking her family here, to the Santa Monica Pier amusement park, so she had prepared for far worse treatment than that.", "It’s 23-degrees and cloudless. I’m wearing a black shirt, long pants and no sunscreen. I intend to prove these soft-skinned so-called ‘surfie types’ that they’ve never experienced a proper summer in their lives – only our winter. If they aren’t peeling skin after a milk run then they have no right to call themselves a seaside city, and I’ll be damned if I play along with their charade. I also have a jumper in my bag, just in case the message isn’t received.", "I’m sliding between packs of families, tourists and unsupervised youths, attempting to find some meaning in this violent mess of vermin and grifts. It’s tremendously American to take a structure intended to shoot great masses of people around high-G turns dozens of metres in the air, and then place it beside the sea, where the salt and water has the greatest access to its metal foundations. The only thing more American is that this is the third time they’ve done it.", "A seagull the size of a Vespa swoops down in front of me and carries off a small child. The family seems too caught up in their fever of sugar and transactions to notice, and while I could tell them, it’s possible the child might be better off with the gulls than here. The amusement park, with all its sideshows’ flashing colours and sparkly sounds, is of course intended to funnel children towards a long career in slot machines. It provides a good grounding in handing over cash on rigged games and then begging your family for more money. It’s a fascinating process to watch up close, and would provide endless anthropological and potentially zoological data. However, the experience leaves a certain kind of grease on the spirit. Almost every metre of available space is taken up by items that are being sold just for the feeling of purchasing something, and the rest of it is taken up by the purchasers. Eventually I buy a stick of fairy floss, throw away the floss and then use the stick to swat people out of the way as I exit. I leave a token amount of smuggled literature behind after covering the bindings in caramel in a hope to trick people into taking it, but I know even that is a long shot.", "When I make it to a safe distance, I look back. I’m far enough away that the sound of waves have begun to replace the rattling of roller coasters. Behind the pier, the Santa Monica Mountains are made pale by a low smog. Near me, a man is either sleeping or passed out in the sand. He’d tried to find shelter from the sun in the shade of a palm tree, but now the shade has moved on, leaving him to audibly sizzle. Towards Venice Beach, a series of empty lifeguard shelters stand on platforms of sand, looking out to sea.", "That night I drink margaritas at a Mexican restaurant with Stephi and Andrew. Little Leo spends the night bouncing on a high chair, completely twisted on salt and cheese. On three hours of sleep and high-proof tequila, I empathise. We go for a drive to get dessert, which turns out to be an incredible concoction of sugar that could only exist in this country. I pass out on the drive home.", "On the way to the airport the next morning, I see a child walking to school wearing a backpack as large as he is. I tell the Uber driver to stop the car and he doesn’t, saying something like ‘sir there are ten cars behind us and this is a one-lane road’. I open the car door and roll out at high speed, landing approximately at this child’s feet. I grab his backpack and throw it away, replacing it with my own much larger and heavier backpack.", "‘This is yours now,’ I say to this stunned child. ‘In it are thousand thoughts far more important than whatever was in that bag.’", "‘My lunch?’ He asks", "‘Absolutely more important than that. You think you’ll eat well in the barricades? Do you? Revolutionaries eat maggoty bread washed down with cheap wine so their fellow workers don’t have to.’", "‘And chocolate?’ He asks, pointing at the Snickers bar in my jacket pocket.", "‘I’m holding that for a friend. He’s one of the fellow workers I mentioned. Now no more questions. You have an important job. It will be thankless. It will be gruelling. But you must do it. I came here with a mission that I couldn’t complete - there was an amusement park, and then some margaritas. In short no-one could’ve done it. Now I have to hand it to you … what’s your name?’", "‘Ted.’", "‘Ted. You need to save America. Can you do that?’", "‘Uhh … ‘", "‘Thank you Ted. I’m counting on you. America is counting on you.’", "I stand up straight and salute him. He salutes back. An eagle flies overhead. I limp back into the Uber, flipping off all twenty cars now piled up behind us, then tell the driver to get me to the airport.", "When I look back, Ted has the bag open and is holding up a book on anarcho-primitivism. I don’t know why, maybe its the way he stammered ‘Uhh’ or the stunned expression he had when he watched his bag fly away, but even as I soar over and away from the city, I know little Ted was going to do something great."],

An inspiring twenty metres tall and bright white, lit up by spotlights at night, visible through the smog that ceilings the city’s stained buildings.", "Her vantage point was claimed by the conquistadors from what the Indigenous people called the Place of God – though certainly not this with this ‘God’ in mind. From this peak you have a 360-degree view of the ring of mountains that Santiago sits within.", "Now, between me these Pope-loving weirdo’s so-called virgin is 300 metres of vertical height and kilometres of winding pathway to surmount it. Sure there’s a cable car, but that’s out of the question. A journey to the Mother, religious or not, must be overcome, not provided at the price of 10,000 CHP. It must be difficult, gruelling, hazardous even. Or else it’s not worth doing. No, these are not impediments, they’re necessities.", "It’s the metal barricade that’s the problem.", "It’s the villain in uniform baring my great assent that will be the real challenge. Some traitorous carabinero, a representative of over fifty years of brutal oppression and targeted killings staring me down. He’s posing as a security guard maybe, but in a country of midnight disappearances, of tear gas, of prison beatings, this is of course just an act. A tactically mushy and slightly sleepy looking exterior intended to mask the mindless zombie that’s waiting for a reason to exercise extreme and permanent force.", "And now it wants to deny me and every other citizen their god given right to stand over a city, breathe an air that isn’t foul and grey, look down at what was confining them all this time and find it small. To cast a shadow on the buildings that cast their shadow on us, not personally but impersonally, which in every way is far worse.", "And this fascist wants to keep it from us. This rebirth. With his metal fencing and barriers and his … *bollard*.", "Who does he think he is.", "Well not today. At this moment, at this place, at this crucial juncture in history, the fascists will not win. The people will overcome. And even though the map shows there is a path on the other side that leads to the top, I will not be told how to climb a mountain, nor will I waste my time with lateral and circuitous movement. Progress must be made in glorious bounds, not begged inches. There can be no debate, only action.", "But what action, I wonder, staring at this man in his vaguely beige uniform. Do I rush him? Attempt a head-on assault and hang the consequences. Liberty or death and all that. It’s bold, foolhardy maybe, but if I begin the movement will people follow? That’s the question. To die as a martyr is a good way to die. This may be too low stakes to be given a spot in the history books, but is any injustice too small to overlook? It’s hard to say.", "Either way, something must be done.", "### *****",  "I learn some facts about Chile almost immediately after landing. The first is that my modicum of Spanish counts for nothing in this city.", "‘Chile has its own Spanish,’ my Uber driver says after 20 minutes of me wondering what language I’d learnt before I came. ‘The one everyone else speaks didn’t make it over the Andes.’", "The second fact is that Ubers are illegal, but also an entirely accepted method of getting around; a contradiction of legality that will become very familiar throughout my week in Santiago. The real law of this transport system is that if we get pulled over, I just have to say the driver and I are long-time amigos and the police will thank us then wave us along. It’s a beautiful system of nods and winks that keeps this city moving.", "The third fact is that half of my US dollars are worthless here.", "During my check-in at the hostel, I watch the lady at reception take each note I hand over, hold it up to the light to discover a stain, rip, pinprick or overly aggressive crinkle, then shake her head and hand it back to me.", "While I have enough perfect notes for this stay, with every hostel I’m staying at expecting USD as payment, I wonder how far I’m going to get in a continent where beauty standards are applied to a currency of fragile paper. I’m burnt several more times during this trip before I pick up the local custom of applying a full spectrographic analysis of any US note that I’m given no matter if it comes from a bank, cambio (money exchange) or priest.", "To make matters worse, Santiago is one of the most outrageously priced cities in Latin America. Buying a loaf of bread costs me half of my first-born, with the other half going to the three slices of cheese I get as filling. I ask a fruit-seller how prices can be so high while the average salary is so low here, mostly out of frustration that I had no more first-borns to sell and so had to start offering vital organs as payment. He shrugs his shoulders: ‘It is a miracle of the city.’", "I quickly realise the best way to stretch my money here is by spending it all on the one thing that’s cheap: high-proof booze. This of course provides all the calories one might need in a day, while offering a tremendous slant to the vision that makes every bill almost inoffensive.", "It’s during one of these fiscally responsible binges that I meet a man who tells me he lived in Australia for three years and was wondering if he could practice his English. I tell him that I’d been looking for a good conversation with a local who was willing to get the next round.", "He orders two pisco sours and I, wondering what he plans to do while I drink them, ask what it’s like to be home. He thinks about it for a while, which gives me time to down this concoction of sugar that I eventually discover is masking large quantities of alcohol.", "‘It’s strange,’ he says. ‘I was only away for a few years but when I came back it was a different country.’", "I nod and reach for the second sour at the same time he does. After a minute of struggle in which I learn several new Spanish curses I eventually realise this must be some kind of cultural misunderstanding and give it up.", "‘Chile was never this violent,’ he says, ignoring me while I poke around the inside of my glass for a false bottom. ‘Where did these guns come from? We never had that before. They just appeared one day and never left.’", "‘Look, I seem to have left my wallet in Australia. Do you mind?’", "‘It’s the immigration from Venezuela and Columbia. It’s even worse up there so they come down to Chile. But they just end up homeless because the cost of living is so high here.’", "‘I understand. You see I bought an apple this morning and ended up flat broke. Nothing in these pockets besides gratitude and the shakes. Would you be willing to accept the former for some help with the latter?’", "‘They sleep in hospitals and waiting rooms. As long as they don’t make too much noise then they’re allowed to stay. It can get below zero at night so most of the time they stay quiet.’", "‘Look I found a dollar while I was rolling around on the bar’s floor the other night, so if you’re going to be this way then I can get the next round, but you better be good for the next six or so otherwise you’ll be in the hospital with them.’", "We drink until I lose the ability to count or read a clock, so I don’t know when the bartender tells us they’re no longer serving cocktails. I nod and say ‘of course, perfectly fine, I was planning to go home anyway’ then leap over the counter for the shaker. This is standard behaviour for tourists and so after some light spraying from a hose they invite me back tomorrow.", "As I’m wringing out my shirt the man tells me I should get an Uber home because it wasn’t safe to walk. I told him I didn’t have a choice because my legs seemed to have wandered away a few sours ago.", "‘They’re tricky bastards,’ I tell the two men dragging me out. ‘You’ve got to watch them like a hawk or else they’ll run off home without you. I lost them for two weeks in Madrid once and I’m pretty sure they only came back because I had their passport.’", "### *****",  "The next day my legs and I had reconciled enough to make a good show of standing off against this bastardo and his gate.", "I’ve been staring at him for twenty minutes now I’d judge, unblinking, face twitching. Maybe even muttering. I’m not sure. He’s staring too, clearly aware that there could be some kind of confrontation here. Some new spark to the pile of gunpowder that Santiago has stood on since the 2019 *Estallido Social* (the ‘Social Outburst’), where a million people took to the streets to demand a right to live.", "He can see it in my facial contortions. He knows I’m going to run at him. He shakes his head at me, a warning, his hand moving towards to the cannon on his hip, intended to blow the heads off the free thinkers and radicals who understand that barriers must be broken through on sheer principle. He’s prepared for this eventuality.", "Which means he won’t expect guerrilla tactics, I realise. In my stare-down I’ve in fact switch-footed this gestapo. Of course the strong man understands force better than any, meaning that’s all he can imagine. It’s what he’s hoping for. This leaves the door open for a series of hit and runs. Firing from the jungle like a ghost, never seen, gone by the time the reinforcements arrive. The bastards won’t stand a chance.", "### *****", "In October 2019, the Santiago government issued a 30 peso raise on peak hour train tickets. This is in a city where the average monthly cost of public transport was 13.8% of minimum wage. Now these rats in office wanted to raise it.", "It wouldn’t stand.", "On Monday, 7 October 2019, high school students begin an orchestrated campaign to jump the turnstiles that continues throughout the week and into the next. The banner: ‘¡Evade!’.", "14 October, the government releases a statement telling the people to wake up earlier if they wanted to avoid the new fee. Across the city, outrage. The movement grows.", "15 October, the violence begins. A fight between students and police at Santa Ana station. Protestors kick down a metal gate at Plaza de Armas. Four people arrested. Stations close. Security steps up.", "17 October, protestors break into San Joaquin station, destroying turnstiles and ticket machines. By now, 133 arrests have been made, over US$700,000 in damage done.", "18 October, riots! Barricades are constructed in downtown Santiago. The police begin to use tear gas and water cannons. That night, President Sebastian Pinera attends his grandchild’s birthday at a pricey pizza parlour in one of Santiago’s wealthiest districts. A customer takes a photo and releases it on Twitter. The riots spread.", "19 October, the President issues a 15-day state of emergency in the capital, sending in Chile’s militarised national police – the Carabineros. He issues a statement saying Chile is now at war with a powerful and relentless enemy, though doesn’t elaborate on who this enemy is besides it being potentially foreign and certainly at odds with the Chilean way of life.", "Over the next year, the movement metastasises and spreads across the country. Police tactics increase in severity. Protestors are grabbed and put into vans, found later on the side of the road beaten by batons. Rubber bullets are shot at protestors, intended to blind. Eye patches become the new symbol of the revolution. Dozens killed, thousands injured. Within all of this, the single largest protest in Chile’s history, with over a million people occupying Santiago’s streets and hundreds of thousands more marching across the country – all of them demanding President Pinera’s resignation.", "### *****", "I’m standing on the pathway, staring at this armed zombie. To my left, Latin American jungle – a dense maze of alien flora filled with every manor of ungodly creation intended to rip, chew, poison, stab and suffocate whatever stumbles within striking range just for the joy of violence. And while these can be avoided with a quick enough wit, there’s still no certainty that you’ll emerge unharmed. In this city alone there are dozens of dedicated hospitals filled with jabbering loons who’ve made it to the other side of the darkness permanently altered, mind shattered, clutching rosary beads while they babble about visions that defy modern understanding of science.", "Is this hellscape what I’ll have to call my home for the next six months? For the next six years? How long does it take one man to tear down a diseased system? Not just tear it down but rebuild it as well. Is that even possible?", "One must keep in mind that only recently, after the Chilean riots, after a new President was sworn in from the rioter’s own ranks, after the constitutional changes were offered to the people who had kicked open subway doors and burnt trains on the tracks, it was these same people who then struck down the changes they’d asked for. A sign of the power that the elites still had over the country; that when the people were finally given the chance to remove a constitution intended to eradicate the left, designed by the same mind that ordered hundreds of targeted assassinations and thousands more midnight ‘disappearances’, Augusta Pinochet Ugarte (may god molest his soul), the minds of the people were warped by bought media and rhetoric to instead preserve a broken system.", "Now, with the second draft in the hands of a newly elected and entirely right wing committee – headed up by one Hernan Larrain, who’s list of accomplishments include covering up the torture and killings conducted by ex-nazi and friend Paul Schafer during Pinochet’s reign; who himself served happily as a cabinet minister during the same era – can Chile expect a better tomorrow? Can this country be rebuilt? Or is it condemned to burn itself alive over and over so the same goose-stepping phoenix can rise again?", "What can one man in a jungle do against this?", "I put my hands up to indicate a broken spirit, turning to walk away. I can feel the puppet of power relax, believing he’s won through a show of force alone – the people have once again been made to kneel, the walls remain intact. Which is when I pivot, sprint towards the trees, dive head first into the greenery and disappear. The bastard never stood a chance.", "### *****", "In 1970, Chile became the first country to democratically elect a Socialist president: former physician and long-time politician, Salvador Allende.", "It is the history of Latin America that the natural wealth of the land is what invariably causes its people’s poverty. A country filled with gold, silver, copper, nitrate, fertile soil and, most importantly, endless exploitable labour, will always attract a more powerful and more inhumane foreign interest than whatever might currently occupy the country, to come and claim what’s there for its own.", "After the invasion, and once the killings are done, the wealth is shipped out of the country as quickly as possible, leaving the native people not only broken, sacked and poor, but even further behind the rest of the world, which by then has used the stolen wealth to advance their own technology and industries, and then demanded that the victims pay to share in it, intentionally ignoring what had already been paid.", "This was Allende’s thinking when he nationalised Chile’s large-scale industries like the copper mines and the banks. By removing private enterprises from the biggest cash grabs in the country and giving it to the people, then Chile might be able to lift itself up to the level of all the players that had made it there off its back.", "In the first three years of Allende’s presidency, a mass of sweeping reforms began to invert Chile’s class structure. Wages were increased, taxes on the poor decreased, railway construction was diverted to serve the poorest communities first, universities were made tuition-free to ensure democracy in its education, free milk was given to children to ensure their bones grew. In all this, inflation went down from 36% to 22% in the first year of the presidency.", "This is of course exactly what the foreign interests were afraid of.", "Declassified documents show that the CIA spent $2.6 million financing the campaigns of Allende’s opponents in the 1964 election, which certainly assisted in Allende’s loss. Despite further investments of incredible fortunes against him, Allende won the 1970 election, forcing Kissinger and the CIA into a new approach with Project FUBELT, which contained the ‘Track I’ and ‘Track II’ plans.", "Track I involved an attempt to overturn Allende’s election through some coordinated trickery with Chilean congress. The outgoing president Eduardo Frei was instructed to convince congress to spit on the constitution and fenangle the equivalent of a human doorstop, Jorge Alessandri, into the presidency while it was still determining who had won the incredibly tight election. Jorge would then immediately concede the position, forcing elections to recommence but this time allowing Frei to run for presidency again, no longer confined by the two consecutive term limit on the presidency.", "Luckily, congress was not so easily convinced to rip up its own constitution, and while it still forced Allende to sign an agreement that limited his powers in some ways, even they could not hold back the people’s wishes.", "So, immediately after Allende won the 1970 election, Nixon directed the CIA to ‘put the pressure’ on the Allende government. This led to series of embargo’s that strangled Chile’s export of copper, which had so recently made the US copper companies Anaconda and Kennecott fortunes. In exchange for a lack of exports, the price of imports increased massively, a disaster in a place where food is a major import. This was all while the US removed a considerable amount of the financial support it had been providing when the pimp Frei was forcing Chile to turn tricks for US corporate interests.", "By 1973, inflation was astronomical. Strikes were weekly. Shelves were empty.", "All of which meant there was no need for the Track II plan – a direct US military invasion to overturn Allende’s presidency. There was no need because one was already beginning locally.", "On 11 September 1973, Santiago was stormed by its own military. The palace was bombed repeatedly by the Air Force, while soldiers shot into its windows. People ran to shelters and family homes to hide while their city was torn apart outside. At this time, Allende was in his office, the doors barricaded by chairs and tables, addressing the people through an emergency radio.", "When the soldiers eventually broke through the palace doors, after they had shot the guards and workers still loyal to the country, Allende was found dead in his office, holding an AK-47 that Fidel Castro had gifted him.", "### *****", "I’m crashing through thorns and hazardous footing, becoming one with the forest. While I eventually discover pathways that have been trampled into the ground, potentially from other revolutionaries, I decide that the more dangerous choice is to vary my terrain. Give my ankles even a moments break and they’ll become weak and soft. Luckily there’s been rain recently so there’s plenty of slippery territory to choose from near the cliff edge.", "The secret to any good hike is ensuring you minimise weight. Keep the equipment lean, only the essentials. This is why it’s important to starve yourself for at least three days before any major vertical assent. Anyone who says you must eat a solid meal before a climb is an amateur and should not be trusted, on this or anything else they might say next.", "In the same vein, it’s important to lower the amount of water in your system. This is dead weight and should be stripped from your body in total. Following these steps will ensure success.", "With this in mind, my first stop that morning had been to the pharmacia, where I bought a dozen diuretics and a laxative. I crush them into a powder and snort the compound on the street to intimidate any potential pickpockets and ensure maximum absorption. After two hours of hideous but necessary cleansing, I was physically ready for this pilgrimage.", "This is to say that I had a crucial edge as I scramble up a near 85-degree incline, cutting straight through several winding and traction-heavy pathways bordered by wooden fencing that require some hurdling. I believe the effort was aided by the terrific woozy feeling that had begun to settle in, making the ascent pass quickly.", "At the top I stop and turn. The view of the city had become dim while the details of the surrounding mountain had clarified. The peaks of the Andes are a pure white that, by contrast, darken the mountain’s tectonic rock. This city offers regular vibrations to the residents as the mountains continue to grow. Though with the snow on the top melting each year, the growth is negligible.", "I continue upwards until I discover a stone wall that separates the formidable jungle from the last stretch of road leading up to the Mother. With a series of pitons I manage to make it over, rolling into a group of children eating ice cream, who had taken the other route. I decided it was best not to apologise to them or the parents as it might indicate there was something wrong with my behaviour, potentially leading to some kind of scene. Instead I walked off with confidence, using my gait to convince all parties involved that children are designed to be knocked over every now and again and that this was simply their day.", "After only a few hundred metres of comparatively flat terrain and an endless number of tourists who of course scatter with the help of a thorny branch picked up during the climb.", "And then I discover her. The Mother.", "By standing at the base of the statue and looking up, you can almost feel god’s hands pinch a nerve in your neck as you form a right angle between it and the rest of your spine. The pure white stone is blinding in the sun, so it hurts to look at for too long without sunglasses. All in all, it’s a perfect continuation of the Catholic tradition of faith through pain. I say a silent prayer for the workers who had to bring her up here, who would have been all but ordained by the end of the process.", "Turning away from here I look out to what she sees.", "Santiago.", "From here I’m almost able understand the great beast. A place endlessly conquered, from abroad and within, demanding change and then rejecting it. A country that fourteen years after watching its palace be bombed would democratically elect to uninstall the vicious dictator who did it. A referendum won through a campaign of song, played on TV each night, promising a return of joy to the country. And somehow, absurdly, it worked. Pinochet was forced to stand down. The spirit of the country had won.", "The last words to Allende’s name:", "‘Workers of my country, I have faith in Chile and its destiny. Other men will overcome this dark and bitter moment when treason seeks to prevail. Go forward knowing that, sooner rather than later, the great avenues will open again and free men will walk through them to construct a better society.", "‘Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!", "‘These are my last words, and I am certain that my sacrifice will not be in vain, I am certain that, at the very least, it will be a moral lesson that will punish felony, cowardice, and treason.’", "The other secret to a successful climb is how to tackle the descent. This is quite simple. A heavy meal and a few litres of water at the summit should provide enough mass that, by leaping over the edge, you will be able to crash through any impediments your body might encounter on the way down.", "After an overpriced by necessary meal, I take one last look at the city, place my hands on the stone wall, then I jump and wait for the glorious rush of free fall."],
