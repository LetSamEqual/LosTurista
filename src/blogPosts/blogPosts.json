Cheers’ - Janelle and Lex", "‘Enjoy the adventures brother. I’ll follow your tales.

Deranged man at large. Last seen hurtling towards the international airport without regard for law, traffic lights or common sense.", "Witnesses on the scene describe a man with crazed hair and wide eyes, looking everywhere but the road in front of him. They say this man repeatedly failed to indicate, except once, the wrong way and likely by accident, when he stuck an arm and half his body out the window to shake a tattered copy of The Motorcycle Diaries at a driver recklessly obeying the speed limit near him. The man’s place in the book was reportedly being kept by a crumpled ticket to the former socialist country of Chile. The Uber driver, at that point cowering in the passenger seat next to the deranged man, is now in hospital recovering from the shock.", "While details are still emerging, this paper has uncovered the following facts: renowned champagne communist and man of infamously unrestrained id, Sam Henderson, recently escaped gainful employment to pursue his dream of being a ‘full-time layabout’.", "Friends and family say they regret ignoring the early warning signs that have now manifested in his total psychotic break. At the time they believed it was only a prolonged but certainly temporary bout of Marxism brought on by years of abusing radical theory. When contacted, his mother had this to say:", "‘Look it was of course concerning to find a copy of Das Kapital under his bed in high school, but at the time I told myself that a lot of kids his age were experimenting with recreational philosophies. I mean god, I went to the Chicago School of Fine Arts — I spent six months calling all my friends ‘comrade’, so this didn’t seem that different.", "‘But since then he’s apparently been getting into the harder stuff like Fischer and Zizek, and well … that’s when I really started to worry. Political philosophies are a lot stronger these days given what they’re synthesising it with. But still, I never thought … I’m sorry, let’s end it there.’", "When interviewed later, the Uber driver, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, says he only remembers fragments of the ordeal and that honestly he wishes he could remember less. However, with assistance from the hospital psychologist and a priest, this paper learnt that the driver had been parked on the side of the road, enjoying ‘a perfectly decent oat latte’, when his door was suddenly yanked open by a crazed man, who threw a large backpack at the driver and yelled ‘move over you bastard, I’m driving’.", "Later, as they hit the highway, the deranged man began interrogating the then ex-driver for opinions on his beard. ‘He just kept asking if I thought he looked more Guevara or Castro-esque. Over and over. Eventually I said Guevara, which I think was the right answer because he stopped asking and began humming the Cuban national anthem, but really it looked more homeless than anything else.’", "Afterwards, when the driver began to pray, the man yelled that there was no need to panic because soon he’d be ‘lifting the boot of capitalism off the necks of the working class so they can finally breathe the fresh air of liberty’. The driver, at that point hysterical, tried to explain that he’s a full-time graphic designer, that this was just a side hustle he does for art supply money, and that his neck feels perfectly untrodden upon but thank you for asking. The deranged man appeared not be listening however, and instead began to nod insanely while whispering ‘I am the child of the revolution’. At that point the former driver decided the best course of action was to remain silent.", "According to police reports, the hijacked KIA Allantro was next seen screeching into the international drop-off zone in a shower of neck pillows and 100mL containers ejected from the luggage of leaping pedestrians. Security camera footage show the deranged man parking the car first halfway up the curb, and then after a few minutes of struggle, the rest of the way up, leaving the traffic officer baffled at where to even start. At this point the deranged man took both of the shivering Uber driver’s hands in his own, promised that he would remember his service when ‘they begin constructing the guillotines’ and then stiffed him on the tip.", "The last thing the driver remembers seeing before passing out was a skinny man with a large backpack hurtling red-roped bollards, headed towards security, armed with an unnatural certainty that everything was going to turn out just fine."],

I’ve spent the last 13 hours in a high-speed middle finger to God, travelling at 1,000km/h halfway around the curve of the Earth just to make sure he gets a good look at it.", "Now, as punishment, he’s landed us in the most soulless and psychopathic viper’s nest to ever infest this good, green Earth: American border control.", "It’s the bag full of explosives that I’m worried about.", "A carry-on filled to capacity with Klein, Chomsky, Fischer, Mao’s Little Red Book, The Open Veins of Latin America. The most depraved and twisted minds of recent history splattered in ink and serif across hundreds of pages. All of it intended to blow a hole wide open in the swaying monolith of late-stage capitalism. A Jenga tower built to mind-bending heights with material pulled from its own foundations, now leaning precariously, waiting for someone to pull that last block. Or … for someone to tip the table.", "Don’t worry America, help is on its way. I just need to get this literary C4 past the bastards in uniform.", "The agent directly ahead of me is sitting within some kind of Perspex cube, the bottom half of his body out of sight, or potentially removed, neutered to ensure commitment to duty, honour and American spirit.", "It is a common belief that fascism is a masculine ideology, and so requires the necessary equipment to perform it correctly. But this is not true. What a dictator wants more than anything is an army of sexless clones, unburdened by choice or needs. Certainly not men contaminated with all their instincts and urges. If anything, fascism is ace. A million short, back and sides–sporting Ken dolls, all smooth below the eyebrows. And while I don’t think America has got there yet, it surely is a matter of time.", "I’m wondering whether they’d just take the balls or keep it easy and remove anything that dangles when I realise I’m up next.", "Will they see the socialist in my eyes, I wonder, or just assume it? Will the flight attendants discover what’s been blocking the plane’s toilets for the second half of the ride? A mound of scraggly, slogan-filled beard hair, shaved in anticipation of this exact moment. Will they call up ahead to tell them that there’s a baby-faced revolutionary attempting to mix in with the regular, freedom-loving passengers?", "‘Attention all officers and would-be vigilantes, we have a commie on the loose, some ex-bearded freak of politics, possibly holding a carry-on bloated with anti-American propaganda, clearly intending to sow dissent among the poor and feeble-minded. We advise to shoot on sight. I repeat, shoot on sight.’", "I lean over the counter when I arrive and see that the man does appear to have a lower body, which is a relief, though his expression is that of a creature with nothing left to its name besides the privilege of being the country’s first line of defence, so my relief is in no way total.", "As we go through the usual process of name, passport, ESTA, address while in America, rising moon sign and Hogwarts house, we come to the question of next destinations, and as suspected, the process stops.", "My trip to South America is immediately noted as suspicious. I can see the words ‘Guatemala, Venezuela, Chile, Cuba’ beginning to circle his head like some hideous bats. The recent history of government-backed coups fresh in the Latin American mind and wholly forgotten by US citizens besides an unconscious distrust of the continent as a whole. He squints at me.", "‘Why are you going to South America?’", "‘Just a holiday.’", "‘Just a holiday?’", "‘Just a holiday.’", "‘Right. And what do you plan to do on this holiday?’", "I don’t know. What do regular, freedom loving, capitalist-supporting, wholly unsuspicious people do on any holiday? Is the word ‘holiday’ not all-encompassing? Is there any other way to holiday, and is one of them wrong? He’s staring. I’ve got to answer.", "‘Well to ensure that America’s interests remain protected of course. Operation Mongoose 2.0. Continue the US-backed psyops in the land of fruit and sugar sir.’", "‘What?’", "‘Backpacking.’", "‘Backpacking?’", "‘Yes sir.’", "‘I see … ’", "He looks down at the bag next to me.", "‘What’s in that?’", "‘Twelve dozen rounds of ammunition, a quart of vodka and a map of high-density areas.’", "He nods, somewhat soothed by the fact that I intend to assimilate. But still, his expression is sinister. The mood twisted. It’s too little too late and his hand is already on the big red button clearly attached to a silent alarm. I’ve prepared for this scenario however, and I have an ace up my sleeve.", "I clear my throat to get his attention, then I point a finger directly at my face. The message is clear. I’m a white English-speaker. There’s nothing he can do. His hands are tied. He sighs and moves his hands away from the button, his shoulders slumped. There will be no commendation for his service today.", "He stamps my passport, registers my fingerprints, takes a photo and performs a perfunctory cavity search before waving me on.", "Of course I was never worried. My quick wit and Invisalign smile has gotten me through rougher patches than whatever can be concocted by some castrated weirdo trapped in a box.", "I stride through to baggage collection, a free man. Around me, hoards of grim-faced tourists squinting and leaning and bobbing in hope that the particular black, wheeled luggage coming around the bend is their black, wheeled luggage. But it isn’t, and it won’t be, because it’s already lost. It was thrown out before the plane took off to save them the trouble of having to lose it later.", "It’s a known fact that somewhere out there on the Pacific is a floating island of black, wheeled luggage – baking in the sun, covered in barnacles, bouncing off breaching whales and melting icebergs, following some great gyre to the promised land that all lost things eventually wash up. It’s a miracle of nature, one that my particular bag unfortunately will not be a part of as I have stuffed my life and my profane material into one carry-on sized bag that has not and will not leave my side for the rest of this trip.", "I stride past these leaning, bobbing suckers scratching their heads about where their luggage has gone.", "I am the enlightened traveler. King of vagabonds and vagrants. A human RV with a full tank and an open highway ahead of me, aimed at a place beyond borders or order, no tether to the spiritual highs I can and will achieve.", "‘Sir, can we have a quick word with you?’", "Shit.", "###Some history about LA, as told by an Uber driver on the way to my cousin’s house", "It’s a little known fact that entropy was discovered through a careful examination of LA traffic.", "The conditions move further towards chaos the closer we get to the city. And yet somehow there is a rhythm to it. A communal understanding. Each spot on the highway is yours for the taking, you just have to be brave enough to take it. This is communicated in every honk, every middle finger, every scream out of the driver’s window. This is language of the road, and it is beautiful.", "‘Man I get flipped off twice a day in this city. At least twice a day. It’s just part of living in LA.’ The Uber driver screams. All the windows are open, letting in the smog so we can achieve that woozy kind of high that makes a long drive feel like teleportation.", "‘Well let’s try to get it done now,’ I say. ‘Save you from having to worry about it for the rest of the day.’", "‘Good point,’ he says and then merges suddenly across three lanes to another lane moving slightly faster. A loud honk. One down.", "‘Some of them have full-time jobs man,’ he says, back on the tents we’ve been discussing, each containing some of LA’s 70,000 homeless. Everywhere we go they seem to outnumber the buildings.", "‘It’s crazy. Even in the slums you’re paying at least $2,500 a month for a one bedroom. $2,500 and you’re still gonna get robbed in your own home. Say you’re a security guard getting paid $3,000 a month, you’re still living in a tent. It’s capitalism man. People are buying houses just to make money, and if you don’t have any then you don’t get a house. Simple as that.’", "Familiar story. But it’s nice to know it’s not just us. I will learn later that what we call negative gearing is called the appreciation tax.", "We make a sharp turn on to an exit from about two lanes away and for a moment the direction of our car becomes perpendicular to the flow of the traffic. The honks are starting to become soothing.", "‘I don’t know about you, but sometimes you have to wonder if Covid was a scam.’ My eyebrows shoot into orbit. I mean of course, but still, it’s bold. I remind myself to add him to my mailing list.", "‘Maybe I’m crazy man. I don’t know. I went along with it fine for a while. But now … now things are worse man, but only for some people.’", "The roads are starting to narrow, the size of the housing shrinking from apartments to homes, all painted white.", "‘It just seems like …  I don’t know. It’s bad. It’s bad everywhere man.’", "We’re turning on to my cousin’s street. There’s been maybe five seconds of silence, which for this ride is an eternity. Eventually he turns to me and says, ‘but hey, at least the weather is nice here.’", "I nod and look at the window. It’s true. It’s a beautiful day.", "By coincidence my cousin is standing outside with the whole family: husband, child, the family dog. It’s a entirely warming scene. There is no irony or cynicism. Her husband, Andrew, is American by birth and endlessly positive. My cousin, Stephi, passes her baby Leo to Andrew and hugs me.", "I have a shower and pass out for three hours. I wake up confused, shaky, entirely unsure where I am and how I got there. I wander around the house trying to sort it all out. I walk into rooms just to forget why I’m there. I open the fridge, then close it, then open it again. There’s artisanal sour dough in the freezer. It’s delicious.", "By the time I make it outside it’s midday. The sky is a deep blue and cloudless. There are palm trees lining the street, and all the lawns are a stunning green.", "###A day at the beach", "Above me, people are screaming and the sound is dropping towards me at a tremendous rate. When I look up to find the source of the noise, someone shoves me from behind, nearly knocking me to the ground. I spin around and punch a mother in the face, but she barely registers the blow. She had of course woken up that morning knowing she was going to be taking her family here, to the Santa Monica Pier amusement park, so she had prepared for far worse treatment than that.", "It’s 23-degrees and cloudless. I’m wearing a black shirt, long pants and no sunscreen. I intend to prove these soft-skinned so-called ‘surfie types’ that they’ve never experienced a proper summer in their lives – only our winter. If they aren’t peeling skin after a milk run then they have no right to call themselves a seaside city, and I’ll be damned if I play along with their charade. I also have a jumper in my bag, just in case the message isn’t received.", "I’m sliding between packs of families, tourists and unsupervised youths, attempting to find some meaning in this violent mess of vermin and grifts. It’s tremendously American to take a structure intended to shoot great masses of people around high-G turns dozens of metres in the air, and then place it beside the sea, where the salt and water has the greatest access to its metal foundations. The only thing more American is that this is the third time they’ve done it.", "A seagull the size of a Vespa swoops down in front of me and carries off a small child. The family seems too caught up in their fever of sugar and transactions to notice, and while I could tell them, it’s possible the child might be better off with the gulls than here. The amusement park, with all its sideshows’ flashing colours and sparkly sounds, is of course intended to funnel children towards a long career in slot machines. It provides a good grounding in handing over cash on rigged games and then begging your family for more money. It’s a fascinating process to watch up close, and would provide endless anthropological and potentially zoological data. However, the experience leaves a certain kind of grease on the spirit. Almost every metre of available space is taken up by items that are being sold just for the feeling of purchasing something, and the rest of it is taken up by the purchasers. Eventually I buy a stick of fairy floss, throw away the floss and then use the stick to swat people out of the way as I exit. I leave a token amount of smuggled literature behind after covering the bindings in caramel in a hope to trick people into taking it, but I know even that is a long shot.", "When I make it to a safe distance, I look back. I’m far enough away that the sound of waves have begun to replace the rattling of roller coasters. Behind the pier, the Santa Monica Mountains are made pale by a low smog. Near me, a man is either sleeping or passed out in the sand. He’d tried to find shelter from the sun in the shade of a palm tree, but now the shade has moved on, leaving him to audibly sizzle. Towards Venice Beach, a series of empty lifeguard shelters stand on platforms of sand, looking out to sea.", "That night I drink margaritas at a Mexican restaurant with Stephi and Andrew. Little Leo spends the night bouncing on a high chair, completely twisted on salt and cheese. On three hours of sleep and high-proof tequila, I empathise. We go for a drive to get dessert, which turns out to be an incredible concoction of sugar that could only exist in this country. I pass out on the drive home.", "On the way to the airport the next morning, I see a child walking to school wearing a backpack as large as he is. I tell the Uber driver to stop the car and he doesn’t, saying something like ‘sir there are ten cars behind us and this is a one-lane road’. I open the car door and roll out at high speed, landing approximately at this child’s feet. I grab his backpack and throw it away, replacing it with my own much larger and heavier backpack.", "‘This is yours now,’ I say to this stunned child. ‘In it are thousand thoughts far more important than whatever was in that bag.’", "‘My lunch?’ He asks", "‘Absolutely more important than that. You think you’ll eat well in the barricades? Do you? Revolutionaries eat maggoty bread washed down with cheap wine so their fellow workers don’t have to.’", "‘And chocolate?’ He asks, pointing at the Snickers bar in my jacket pocket.", "‘I’m holding that for a friend. He’s one of the fellow workers I mentioned. Now no more questions. You have an important job. It will be thankless. It will be gruelling. But you must do it. I came here with a mission that I couldn’t complete - there was an amusement park, and then some margaritas. In short no-one could’ve done it. Now I have to hand it to you … what’s your name?’", "‘Ted.’", "‘Ted. You need to save America. Can you do that?’", "‘Uhh … ‘", "‘Thank you Ted. I’m counting on you. America is counting on you.’", "I stand up straight and salute him. He salutes back. An eagle flies overhead. I limp back into the Uber, flipping off all twenty cars now piled up behind us, then tell the driver to get me to the airport.", "When I look back, Ted has the bag open and is holding up a book on anarcho-primitivism. I don’t know why, maybe its the way he stammered ‘Uhh’ or the stunned expression he had when he watched his bag fly away, but even as I was flying over the city, I know little Ted was going to do something great."],
